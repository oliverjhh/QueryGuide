## TrailQuery Compass Roadmap

1. **Templates & Variants**
   - Expand the current JSON template to support collaborative prompts and research logs.
   - Add a lightweight editor for building new variants on the fly.

2. **Persistence Layer**
   - Record every generated guide in a local `journals/` folder with metadata.
   - Ship a small web UI that lets future-me browse past explorations.

3. **Sharing**
   - Build markdown/export helpers for quick handoffs.
   - Provide a `diff` command to compare what changed between guides.

4. **Workflow Integrations**
   - Hook into Notion or Obsidian via markdown export templates.
   - Add reminders and reflection prompts that run weekly.
